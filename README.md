I am a PhD student currently focusing on Evolutionary Computation and Spiking Neural Networks. My repositories vary from Network Science, the field of study on which I did my Master's thesis "Counting Subgraphs in Online Networks", to optimization problems and general algorithmic strategies (with some Google and Kaggle contests), to Data Science and Machine Learning projects, along with some other personal projects. I hope you find some of my projects useful and feel free to use them and improve them! I am still trying to gather some interesting projects I've developed over the years to include them in this git profile.

## Repositories (UNDER UPDATES)


 - **StreamFaSE** - A framework for updating subgraph frequencies in streaming networks that I developed for my master's thesis published in "Henrique Branquinho, Luciano GrÃ¡cio, and Pedro Ribeiro. **StreamFase: An online algorithm for subgraph counting in dynamic networks**. *In Proceedings of the 9th International
Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications*, 2020.
 - **Optimization problems** ðŸ§  (under work ðŸ”§ https://github.com/henriquejsb/GeneralProblems )- A set of optimization problems and solutions to them where a range of strategies are employed (backtracking, greedy, dynamic programming, geometric algorithms...)
 - **Simplified C compiler** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/SimplifiedCCompiler ) - A compiler for a simplified version of C developed as a college assignment for a Compilers course during my Bachelor's.
 - **Network Science Projects** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/NetworkScience ) - A set of projects I developed for a Network Science course during my Master's. Includes different network generators (BarabÃ¡si-Albert, ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi), some studies on motif analysis, community discovery and PageRank, diffusion and cascading behavior, and a small analysis on a chess network as a final project.
 - **Unimaze** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/UNIMAZE ) - A 2D game that tells the story of a college student trying to finish all his courses in one year so his parents won't find out he has been failing every year, developed in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
 - **SECD and Unification Algorithm** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/SECD_Unification ) - An implementation of a SECD with call-by-name and call-by-value approach , and an implementation of the Unification Algorithm in Haskell.
 - **Gif Encoder**(https://github.com/henriquejsb/GIF_Encoder ) - A tool to convert jpeg and png image files to GIF.
 - **Taxi Services Heatmap** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/TaxiServicesSQL ) - An academic project where I used folium, PostgreSQL and PostGIS to create a heatmap of taxi services with Portugal's district's borders or with a grid based display.

### Currently working on

- **Evolving SNNs** - Developing a general framework for the automatic design of Spiking Neural Networks.
