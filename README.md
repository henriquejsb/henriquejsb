I am a Master of Computer Science, currently looking for new opportunities in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. My repositories vary from Network Science , the field of study on which I did my Master's thesis "Counting Subgraphs in Online Networks", to optimization problems and general algorithmic strategies (with some Google and Kaggle contests), to Data Science and Machine Learning projects, along with some other personal projects. I hope you find some of my projects useful and feel free to use them and improve them!

## Repositories 


 - **StreamFaSE** - A framework for updating subgraph frequencies in streaming networks that I developed for my master's thesis published in "Henrique Branquinho, Luciano Gr√°cio, and Pedro Ribeiro. **StreamFase: An online algorithm for subgraph counting in dynamic networks**. *In Proceedings of the 9th International
Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications*, 2020.
 - **Optimization problems** üß†- A set of optimization problems and solutions to them where a range of strategies are employed (backtracking, greedy, dynamic programming, geometrical algorithms...)
 - **Simplified C compiler** - A compiler for a simplified version of C developed as a college assignment for a Compilers course during my Bachelor's.
 - **Network Science Projects** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/NetworkScience) - A set of projects I developed for a Network Science course during my Master's. Includes different network generators (Barab√°si-Albert, Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi), some studies on motif analysis, community discovery and PageRank, diffusion and cascading behavior, and a small analysis on a chess network as a final project.
 - **SECD and Unification Algorithm** (https://github.com/henriquejsb/SECD_Unification) - An implementation of a SECD with call-by-name and call-by-value approach , and an implementation of the Unification Algorithm in Haskell.

### Currently working on
- **Chessano**‚ôüÔ∏è - A chess bot with an initial approach of using minimax and neural networks with supervised learning to evaluate positions, with intentions of scaling it to a reinforcement learning approach.
- **StreamFaSE (Motif analysis)** - Currently improving the work done with StreamFaSE to include a motif analysis of the varying subgraph frequencies in the streaming network rather than just the frequencies alone.
